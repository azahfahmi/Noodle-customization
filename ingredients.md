Any brand of instant noodles : Prefeably maggi, yippee or top ramen, but others will do.
                                     Would not recomend Indomie, cannot be made better in any way, also have not tried ching's, so do not ecommend that as well.

Spice : Mild-ish ones like turmeric and chilli will do vey nicely.

To make better tasting /  milder : Carots. Small pieces ( round, please ) do well in absorbing a lot of spice.And if you're weird... MILK. hAvE nEvE TIeD and never will ( no judge to people who like milk in nooles btw) 

Actually, always add carrots?
