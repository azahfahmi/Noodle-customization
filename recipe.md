Boil the water, and pour the seasoning into the pot / whatever you're using. As usual, add the noodles in. 

FOR MILD : Cut up carrots.. like.. (look at inserted photo, please) this.
           Add a bit more water. The spice has a habit of seeping into the water,so if you throw away some of the water ( or drink it as juice, idk, and idc ) so you're left ith mild, carroty noodles.

FOR SPICY : Add less water. IF you like it watery ( like me ) , and add tumeric / sometimes some chilli, do not add full chilli / turmeric / seasoning entirely. In middle of cooking, take out majority of the noodles and put into small plate. SEPERATELY add chilli / turmeric / seasoning or powder. Mix thoroughly. STILL KEEP ASIDE SOME MENIONED ABOVE ASIDE. Then put back in pot / utensil /whatever you're using. Once time to eat, slowly pour water on top of noodles you've already scooped out into plate / bowl /  cup / utensil / whateve you're using. Then mix some mentioned above before every one - two - three - four - okay you get the point. 

FOR HEALTHY : As I said above, follow the FOR MILD tutorial. Cannot make it healthier, but makes it UNUNHEALTHIER (two uns on pupose btw). But you can add the spice via turmeric or chilli. Turmeric is less spicy but better for you , and you tongue and i THINK it's good for diabetes- I MEAN digestion ( can't fix indigestion though, sad, okay, bye!!!!)
